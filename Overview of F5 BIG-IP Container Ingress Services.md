# Overview of F5 BIG-IP Container Ingress Services

F5 BIG-IP Container Ingress Services (CIS) lets you manage your F5 BIG-IP device from Kubernetes or OpenShift using either environmentâ€™s native CLI/API.

The F5 BIG-IP CIS (k8s-bigip-ctlr) is a cloud-native connector that can use either Kubernetes or OpenShift as a BIG-IP orchestration platform.

CIS watches the [Kubernetes API] (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/) for specially formatted resources, and updates the BIG-IP system configuration accordingly.
