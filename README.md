# EKS-and-F5-Integration

This project and documentation is intended to demonstrate F5 BIG-IP CIS (Container Ingress Services) can be deployed in Kubernetes using EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) on AWS. 

It will also handle the auto-configuration portion and make necessary changes to the standalone BIG-IP running in the same Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).
